# Data-Jobs_MySQL_PowerBI
In this project I will be analyzing Data Analyst job postings in United States in order to find out what are the most desired skills in the Big Data / Data Science industry. As I am learning new data skills I would like to know what to focus my efforts on and how much salary to expect as junior data analyst. I'll also take a closer look how the job offers changed over time, including the required skills or compensation. I'll be utilizing SQL and PowerBI for data processing, analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
Dataset is taken from Kaggle [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search/data), and the credits go to Luke Barousse, who uses SerpAPI to pull job postings from Google's search results for Data Analyst positions in the United States. Data collection started on November 4th, 2022, and adds ~100 new job postings to this dataset daily. I'll be working with the dataset as of 2024-03-28.

## Questions
During the analysis I'll be trying to get insights on the following aspects:
1. What are the top 10 most popular job titles?
2. Are they also the TOP 10 job titles with best compensation? If not, which are?
3. Which companies pay more, and which ones offer more jobs?
4. What is the salary distribution?
