# Job-Market_PowerBI
In this Power BI case study, I’ll explore a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. I’ll use Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. Then I'll use DAX to build insightful visualizations of the findings. Finally, I’ll create a business dashboard so that I can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

## Dataset
Dataset is a part of DataCamp.com Case Study: Analyzing Job Market Data in Power BI.
